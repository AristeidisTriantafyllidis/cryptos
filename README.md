[![Snyk Security](https://snyk.io/test/github/AristeidisTriantafyllidis/cryptos/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/AristeidisTriantafyllidis/cryptos)

A React web application for tracking live cryptocurrency market data. Browse the top coins, follow trending picks, dive into per-coin price charts, and keep a personal watchlist — all backed by CoinGecko data through a Vercel API proxy.

## ✨ Features

- **Market Overview**: Browse the top cryptocurrencies with live price, market cap, and 24h change.
- **Trending Coins**: See which coins are trending right now.
- **Deep-Dive Charts**: Click into any coin for detailed stats and interactive price history charts.
- **Watchlist**: Save coins you care about and remove them just as easily.
- **Resilient Fetching**: Requests are proxied through Vercel serverless functions with retry logic to avoid CoinGecko rate-limit/CORS issues.
- **Loading Skeletons & Error Boundaries**: Polished loading states and graceful error handling throughout.
